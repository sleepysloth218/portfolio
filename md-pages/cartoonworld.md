**Who:** Me and 2 other Brown University sophomores (Firstname Lastname and Firstname Lastname)

**What:** Interactive virtual world with procedural terrain and stylized shaders.

**When:** December 2021

**Where:** Brown University's CSCI 1230 Computer Graphics course

**Why:**

- Solidify understanding of the realtime graphics pipeline
- Strengthen C++, OpenGL, and GLSL skills
- Work with procedural noise, toon shaders, and interactive realtime camera transformations

  

**How:**
Built entirely in C++ using QtCreator, OpenGL, and GLSL

**Can I try it?**
You can view the source code on [my Github]().

**Future goals:**
Potentially extend or build another similar project with infinite terrain as you move and skybox for more immersion

Cartoon World is a project that was created in collaboration with two other second-year Brown University students for our Intro to Computer Graphics class final. It was programmed entirely in C++ using OpenGL and GLSL shaders in the QtCreator IDE, which was also used to create the application UI.

Features:
- Stylized rendering in a cell shader style using a custom lighting model
- Variable ink drawing style outlines generated using silhouette detection
- Multiple types of terrain generation using value noise and Fractional Brownian Motion
- Pseudo randomly generated trees dispered throughout terrain created by combining custom primitive meshes
- Camera movement that allows user to traverse the scene immersively using keyboard controls
