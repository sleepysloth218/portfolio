**Who:** Me and 3 other Brown University juniors (Firstname Lastname, Firstname Lastname, and Firstname Lastname)

**What:** App prototype for the corporate online education service startup [Sphere](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/sphere)

**When:** November 2022

**Where:** Brown University's CSCI 1300 UI/UX course

**Why:**
- Experience working through the design process in a team setting
- Practice a continuous design process of iterating on designs based on critique feedback
- Learn how to perform user testing to observe interface usability and identify weaknesses

  

**How:**
Prototyped in Figma

**Can I try it?**
You can view the final prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/UQQDwvJ1NN4RIoWJ87S183/Sphere-HiFi-3.0?scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A1282&node-id=1%3A1282).

For this project, we browsed through different YCombinator startups and chose one to prototype their product.

## About The Startup

**Overview:**
[Sphere](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/sphere) is a online education platform that allows employors to assign employees 3-week livestream courses instructed by experts in the field. Through Sphere, employees can learn functional skills to apply to their work, submit online assignments, and network with fellow students and instructors.

**Type of interface:** we chose to prototype a mobile app

**Users:** employees who take courses through Sphere

**Goals for the interface:** allow users to easily navigate between livestreams, assignments, and networking

## Initial Wireframing

As a group, decided on the most important pages of the app to include in our prototype to best capture the intended functionality. We sketched out different design options and combined them together to create one low fidelity mockup:

## Prototype v1

### Initial Mockup

We developed the low-fidelity version into a full high-fidelity Figma mockup and prototype with linked pages to simulate the key interactions within the app.

                    allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Peer Review Feedback

We presented our prototype to a class of our peers in a critique session and received feedback on our design. These were the key points which we chose to address:

- **Home Page**
  - need more distinction between notifications (course related versus chat)
  - progress circle is vague
  - replace list of in progress courses with relevant course assignments/dates
- **Navigation Bar**
  - course icon is unclear
  - too much purple is distracting
- **Course Page**
  - should have ability to enter livestream from course page
  - overview blurb should not be purple like interactive components
  - assignment progress designations unclear
  - unclear where one can start chats with classmates
- **Chat Pages**
  - no distinction between student and instructor in chat list
  - should have link to relevant course from chat page

## Prototype v2

### Revised Mockup

Based on the above feedback, we revised our prototype:

                    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FiOdPWqIsDmFfXbBJ5CRRhq%2FSphere-HiFi-2.0%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A1282%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26starting-point-node-id%3D1%253A1282"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>

### User Testing Feedback

We submitted the revised prototype to [UserTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/) to see how 3 different users would complete a task we gave them within the app.

**Task instructions:**
Find out who the instructor for ENGN1010 is and send them a message.

**Post-test questions**:
1. What frustrated you most about this app?
2. Were there any interactive elements that were not immediately intuitive to you?
3. What did you like about the app?

Here is a summary of the results:
- all users completed the task successfully
- overall, they felt the UI was simple and intuitive
- users found different ways to navigate to the chats (nav bar versus directly through course page)
- all users expressed concerned about lack of nav bar labels and the book icon being unclear
- one mentioned lack of clear distinction between instructor and student on chats page

## Prototype v3

Based on the user testing feedback, we made one final version of our prototype to send to the startup:
